# 1. About The App
Notes App is a simple notes taking app. You can create your notes, edit them, delete them.
It also has a search feature so you can easily search for particular note.

# 2. Technologies
I have used  ReactJs, Vite to create the frontend and Redux Tookit for state management and to persist the notes in local storage.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### To create your own react + vite app run this command:
```bash
npm create vite@latest --your-app-name -- --template react
```
Or you may refer to https://vitejs.dev/guide/   for more details.

## Redux Tookit
Learn more about redux toolkit
- https://redux-toolkit.js.org/
- To use redux in your projects just run the following commands:
  ```bash
  npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit
  ```

## Material UI Icons
Material UI icons are easy to use and provides a ton of choices for each icon. Chances are if you are looking for 
an icon, they have it.

Refer to the offical site to get started with material ui : https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/

## Styled Components
Styled components make it much easier to write css and the option to pass props from the components makes it
a powerful tool for conditional css rendering rules. I prefer it over plain css.

# 3. Prerequisites
## Install Node Package Manager
Refer to https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

# 4. Setup
- Clone the repository or download as zip.
- Go to the cloned folder on your local machine.
- Open terminal and run the following commands in order.
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Now just click/copy the link that would appear in the console and paste on your browser and hit enter. That's it you can now see the project on your local machine.

# 5. Status
The project is completed. Further updates may only be minor bug fixes.
